# REPO_PLACEHOLDER

** What does this project do?

organice is an implementation of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] without the dependency of
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It is built for mobile and desktop browsers and syncs with
Dropbox, Google Drive and WebDAV.

At [[https://200ok.ch/][200ok]], we run an instance of organice at https://organice.200ok.ch,
which is open for anyone to use! organice does not have a back-end
(it's just a front-end application, which uses either Dropbox, Google
Drive or WebDAV as back-end storage). We don't store any kind of data
on our servers - we also don't use analytics on organice.200ok.ch.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/200ok-ch/organice/master/images/screenshot-overview.png]]

** Why is this project useful

Emacs is great, but it's desktop software. For users who want to
access or edit their Org mode files whilst on the go, organice is a
great choice.

** Introduction

If you prefer a video to some text, we've got you covered! For
[[https://emacsconf.org/2019/][EmacsConf 2019]], we've created a 10 minute introductory video into the
rationale and usability of organice.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/200ok-ch/organice/master/images/screenshot-introduction.png]]

You can watch it on:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKc0hcFXCk][Youtube]]
- [[https://media.emacsconf.org/2019/05.html][emacsconf.org]]

* Installation
   <<installation>>

organice is a web application. You can use it from any browser. On iOS
and Android, you can install organice to your homescreen. When
started from there, it will run in full-screen and add some [[offline_support][offline
capabilities]].

Installing to the homescreen on:

- *iOS:*

  Open organice in Mobile Safari. Tap the "share" button and select
  "Add to Home Screen".

- *Android:*

  The exact procedure may differ depending on your browser and Android
  version.  If you discover improvements to the following procedure,
  please [[#contributing][let us know]]!

  First open the organice web page in your mobile browser.

  - On Chrome, tap the "menu" button (three vertically stacked dots)
    and select "Add to homescreen".

  - On Firefox, tap the home icon with the plus sign inside it which
    is immediately to the right of the URL in the address bar.

  - Other browsers may have a similar procedure to one of these.

  At this point, most browsers will present a popup banner with the
  option to "Add to homescreen" or "Install".

  If you want the organice app icon on your home screen to jump to a
  specific =.org= file, and/or if you want multiple app icons on the
  home screen to jump to different files, things can get a bit more
  tricky.  For instance, Chrome only offers "Add to homescreen" the
  first time; once it has been added, the option changes to "Open
  organice".  Firefox allows creation of multiple home screen icons,
  but when opening any of these, organice does not jump directly to
  the specific file which was open when the icon was created.

  Therefore if you want multiple organice bookmark icons on your
  homescreen which jump straight to particular files, you may have
  better luck using another technique.  For example, you can use a
  third-party program called "[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tasomaniac.openwith][Open Link With...]]".  Once that's
  installed, from Chrome, visit the page in organice you want to make
  a homescreen icon for, then tap the "menu" button again, select
  "Share...", and then "Add To Home", then "organice".  Once it's
  added, your home launcher may allow you to change the visible icon
  to the organice icon, or whatever other icon you choose.

* Usage
** Current restrictions/expectations of organice

"Current" means we're working hard on removing the following
restrictions and expectations.

- organice understands only a few in-buffer settings (see [[in_buffer_settings][Supported
  in-buffer configuration]])
  - Other in-buffer settings are imported and re-exported but are not
    editable with organice.
  - In-buffer settings have to be declared before the first headline.
- Other content before the first headline is imported and re-exported,
  but invisible and currently not editable with organice.
- After potential in-buffer settings, your Org file _has to_ begin
  with a headline.

Apart from these restrictions, organice is very robust in reading and
editing your Org file and not breaking any of it. We're having users
with 10'000 lines in their files including all kinds of native Org
functionality - and even these files work just fine in organice!

Generally, when working with distributed Org files, we're recommending
to put them under version control and to check for bugs and racing
conditions between clients.

Please [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/new][file an issue]] if you find additional restrictions, expectations
or bugs that you you wouldn’t have expected.

*** Background information

organice has [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/master/src/lib/parse_org.js][a custom parser]] for Org files. It works quite fine and
has unit tests to prove it. One of the quality goals for the parser is
that when it parses and re-exports an Org file, it should not change
the original file. Not seeing unrelated diffs is important for the
productivity of the user. It sounds trivial, but lots of alternative
products do not live up to this expectation.

Writing a parser for a complex syntax like Org mode in custom code is
hard. Therefore, we are in the process of implementing a proper BNF
based parser and a set of tests behind that. If you're interested,
please check it out: [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser]]

The strategy we're using with regards to the parser is this:

- Keep improving the existing custom parser for new features and make
  bugfixes as long as the new one isn't ready.
- In parallel, work on the new one until there is feature parity
  between both parsers.
- When the new one is finished, integrate it into organice.

** Progressive Web App / Offline Support
    <<offline_support>>

organice can run as a PWA (Progressive Web App) - see the [[installation][installation
instructions]] and does have offline support. From your home screen,
organice will start up in full screen and it will use a [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API][Service Worker]]
to cache the application. On a desktop browser, the Service Worker
will be used automatically. This is implemented using the Create React
App [[https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/#docsNav][Progressive Web App]] functionality which enables the following
features:

- All static assets are cached so that organice loads fast on
  subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity.
- Updates are downloaded in the background.
- organice works regardless of network state, even if offline.
- On mobile devices, organice can be added directly to the user's home
  screen, app icon and all.

Following that, if you start modifying your Org file when offline,
organice will recognize that you are offline and queue up the
synchronization until you are online again.

organice also understands when it's local Org file is outdated
compared to the upstream file and will ask you want you want to do -
pull the one from the synchronization back-end, push the one from
organice or cancel. This happens when you made changes to your file on
at least two machines at the same time without synchronizing them in
the meantime. For this, we recommend to put your Org file under
version control which is the idiomatic solution for changing text
based files on multiple machines in parallel.

* Customization

** General

Since organice implements Org mode, one might wonder if we plan to
duplicate the Emacs configuration strategy. In Emacs Org mode, there's
more than [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Customization.html#Customization][500 variables for customization]] - and on top of that,
there's often two ways to configure things:

1. Using elisp
2. Using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-settings.html][in-buffer settings]]

Modifying Org behavior using elisp (variables) is certainly mighty and
powerful. However, the goal of organice is not to clone Emacs in full.
In fact, it could be argued that this is not possible. Emacs being a
LISP machine has inherent power that cannot be brought to a web
application. Instead, the goal is to make Org mode accessible on
smartphones and for non-Emacs users. For both use-cases, elisp
variable configuration is not an idiomatic or ergonomic option.

organice implements this customization strategy:

- Use in-buffer settings where appropriate
- Build custom and mobile friendly user interfaces where appropriate
  - For example [[capture_templates][capture templates]]

** Supported in-buffer configuration
   <<in_buffer_settings>>

*** In-buffer settings

- =#+TODO=
- =#+TYP_TODO=

*** =#+STARTUP:= options

- =nologrepeat=: Do not record when reinstating repeating item

*** Drawer properties
    :PROPERTIES:
    :END:

- =logrepeat= and =nologrepeat=: Whether to record when reinstating repeating item

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   :PROPERTIES:
   :LOGGING:  logrepeat
   :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Other customizations

For some customizations, organice exposes a mobile friendly user
interface. Please find them in the 'settings' view (cogs icon in the
header on the right).

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/200ok-ch/organice/master/images/screenshot-settings.png]]

* Development

organice is built with [[https://reactjs.org/][React]] and [[https://redux.js.org/][Redux]]. It was bootstrapped with
[[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app][Create React App]]. The tests are written with [[https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro][React Testing Library]].
The internal data structures are written as immutable persistent
data collections with the [[https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js][Immutable]] library.

** Prerequisites

You will need a version of the Node.js engine installed which fulfills
the requirement stated in =package.json=. If you don't already have
this installed, it is recommended to install it via [[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][nvm]]. The organice
repository already contains an =.nvmrc= file, so once you have nvm
installed, the following commands should be sufficient:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nvm install
nvm use
#+END_SRC

** Setup

To install the necessary packages, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
yarn install
#+END_SRC

To test against your own Dropbox account, you'll need to
create a ~.env~ file by copying [[file:.env.sample][.env.sample]] to just ~.env~.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cp .env.sample .env
#+END_SRC

Running the application:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Running the tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
yarn test
#+END_SRC

For searching the Org file, there's a [[file:src/lib/headline_filter_parser.grammar.pegjs][grammar]] for the search
clause. It's written in [[https://pegjs.org/][pegjs]]. Generating the parser code happens
automatically on =yarn start|build|test=. When working on the parser,
you can manually generate it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./bin/compile_search_parser.sh
#+END_SRC

** Testing

When you're developing a new feature and you want to manually test it,
it's best to check it out in a Desktop browser and on your smartphone.
This is how you do that:

*** Desktop

Run the application with =yarn start= which will open organice in your
configured default browser. Alternatively, visit
=http://localhost:3000= in the browser of your choice.

*** Smartphone

There are multiple options on how you can connect from your smartphone
to your computer running organice.

When running organice with =yarn start=, it will show you all the IPs
that the application server is bound to. One will be local to your
computer, one will be on your network (if you're connected to a LAN or
Wifi, that is).

If your smartphone has access to the same network, you can access it
with the given IP address and port number.

If your new feature doesn't require a synchronization back-end, just
open the =sample.org= file which doesn't require a login. You're good
to go.

*Synchronizing with Dropbox or Google Drive*

If your new feature does require the Dropbox or Google Drive
synchronization back-end, there's an extra step you need to perform.

Both Dropbox and Google Drive require a whitelist of domains that they
can be synchronized from. The whitelist for local domains is
exclusively short: =http://localhost:3000=.

Hence, to be able to login from your phone to your dev instance of
organice, you'll need to set up [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding][port forwarding]]. If you have a shell
on your phone and an ssh client, you can do that with the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 user-dev-machine
#+END_SRC

If you don't have a shell on your phone, you can use a dedicated SSH
application (like [[https://www.termius.com/][Terminus]]).

** Contributions

Please see our [[file:CONTRIBUTING.org][contributor guidelines]] and our [[file:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][code of conduct]].

* Deployment
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: deployment
  :END:

Since organice is a front-end only application, it can easily be
deployed to any server capable of serving a static application.

Please note: If you want the hosted application to connect to Dropbox
or Google Drive, please read the section on [[synchronization_back_ends][Synchronization back-ends]].

** FTP

First create the production build locally: =yarn run build=
Note: Creating a build will actually make your =REACT_APP_*= variables
from the =.env= file available under =process.env= even though it'll
be a front-end application.

And then upload to your web-server. Here's a script for your
convenience:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
HOST='your_ftp_server_host'
USER='ftp_user'
PASSWD='ftp_password'

lftp $HOST <<END_SCRIPT
user $USER $PASSWD
mirror -R build/
quit
END_SCRIPT
exit 0
#+END_SRC

** Docker

organice is also available as a Docker image.

*** With =docker-compose=

If [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][docker-compose]] is installed, the following command downloads and
runs the latest image automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

The webserver is listening on port 5000 and can be reached here:
http://localhost:5000

If you want to build the image yourself, use the
=docker-compose-dev.yaml= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up
#+END_SRC

*** Without docker-compose

If =docker-compose= is not installed the command looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name organice twohundredok/organice:latest
#+END_SRC

Again the webserver is listening on port 5000 and can be reached here:
http://localhost:5000

** Heroku
Assuming, you have an account and have installed the [[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli][command line
tools]], deployment is as easy as:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
heroku create
heroku config:set ON_HEROKU=1
git push heroku master
#+END_SRC

** Synchronization back-ends
    <<synchronization_back_ends>>

Note that logging in to Dropbox will only work if you're running the
app on ~http://localhost:3000~, because all redirect URIs must be
specified ahead of time on the Dropbox developer console.

To configure your own application on Dropbox, please go [[https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/][here]] and then
configure this app key in the ~.env~ file. Make sure to add your own
URL as =Redirect URI=.

To configure your own application on Google Drive, please generate an
API key as described on [[https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js][this page]].

*** WebDAV

**** General

With WebDAV support, organice can potentially be used with a multitude
of synchronization backends: Client/Server services [[https://doc.owncloud.com/server/user_manual/files/access_webdav.html][ownCloud]],
[[https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/files/access_webdav.html?highlight=webdav][Nextcloud]] and [[https://download.seafile.com/published/seafile-manual/extension/webdav.md][Seafile]], but also self hosted dedicated WebDAV servers
like [[https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_dav.html][Apache]] or [[https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_dav_module.html][Nginx]].

Since organice is a front-end application, it will login with
JavaScript from within the browser - in turn the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS][Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS)]] headers must be set appropriately. If they are not set,
you will not be able to login to your service from a browser.
Alternatively, if you're using a server like Apache or Nginx, you can
simply get around CORS by hosting organice on the same domain as your
service.

Please note, that when your back-end does not set the correct CORS
headers, organice cannot show you a really semantic error message on
that. The reason is that browsers [[https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#handling-a-response-to-a-cross-origin-request][hide this information]] from
JavaScript. You will simply get a network error. However, you can
easily debug it yourself by looking into the JavaScript console. No
worries, you don't have to be a (JavaScript) developer to find out
about that - here's a [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/wiki#missing-cors-headers][screencast in the Wiki]] to show you how to do it.

**** More information

In the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/wiki#webdav][Wiki]], you'll find lots more information regarding WebDAV:

  - A screencast of how organice works when logging in to a WebDAV
    server
  - Documentation how on to setup your own WebDAV Server with Apache2
    on Debian
  - Documentation how to configure Nextcloud behind haproxy to allow
    WebDAV
  - Documentation on Nextcloud sharing

** Routing

Whilst organice is a true Single Page Application (SPA) and therefore
has no back-end whatsoever, this does have an implication for
deployment with regard to routing. For routes like =example.com/foo=
to work, we need a little something extra. Within the context of a
running SPA, =/foo= would be matched by the React Router and the
proper page would be rendered by JavaScript. When initially requesting
a route like that from the web server itself, the SPA is not running
yet and the web server itself wouldn't find a file called =/foo=. It
would return a 404. The whole topic is explained in depth in this SO
answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/36623117

For https://organice.200ok.ch we've opted to:

- Use the modern HTML5 history API with [[https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/BrowserRouter.md][BrowserRouter]]
- Not configure a back-end for isomorphic routing, because it would
  complicate application and deployment unnecessarily (SEO is a
  non-issue for organice)
- Use good old [[https://httpd.apache.org/][Apache Webserver]] for hosting the compiled static assets

Therefore configuring a catchall is as easy as setting up a
=.htaccess= file in the root of the organice folder containing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteRule ^ /index.html [L]
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Capture templates
   <<capture_templates>>

organice supports capture templates by implementing a flexible
mechanism using URL parameters. These three of the following
parameters are required and must be URL encoded:

- ~captureTemplateName~: the name of the capture template to use. This
  capture template must already exist in Settings > Capture templates.
- ~captureFile~: the =path= (for Dropbox) or =id= (for Google Drive)
  of the file in which to execute the capture template.
- ~captureContent~: the content you'd like to capture. This content
  will be placed at the cursor position if specified in the capture
  template (with ~%?~), or at the end of the template if its not
  specified.

You can also specify additional custom variables for use in your
templates. They should be in the format ~captureVariable_<your custom
variable>~, and should also be URL encoded. In your capture template
they'd show up as ~%<your custom variable>~.

Important: At this point, organice assumes that you'll capture your
entries into a header - hence, you'll have to specify a "header path".

** Examples
*** Simple: Capture a string

Say, you want to capture thoughts/todos as they occur to you. You
might want to have a capture template to just get these things out of
your head.

This makes for a good "Inbox" capture template:

*Capture Template*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,* TODO %?
  %U
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Example URL*

https://organice.200ok.ch?captureTemplateName=Inbox&captureContent=Read+up+on+capture+templates&captureFile=/org/things.org

*Result*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,* TODO Read up on capture templates
  [2019-09-08 Sun 20:54]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** With custom variable
     <<media_capture>>

If you want to add web pages to a reading queue (with a title, a
capture date and a URL), this would be a good starting point:

*Capture Template*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,* %?
  %u

  - URL: %mediaURL
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Example URL*

https://organice.200ok.ch?captureTemplateName=Media&captureContent=Play+Emacs+like+an+instrument&captureFile=/org/media.org&captureVariable_mediaURL=https://200ok.ch/posts/2018-04-27_Play_Emacs_like_an_Instrument.html

*Result*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,* Play Emacs like an instrument
  [2019-09-08 Sun]

  - URL: https://200ok.ch/posts/2018-04-27_Play_Emacs_like_an_Instrument.html
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Bookmarklets

Since organice is a web application, you can use the capture templates
feature to create bookmarklets, of course! For example, if you want a
bookmarklet to add the current page (title, capture date and URL) to
your reading queue using [[media_capture][this capture template]], all you need is a
little bit of JavaScript:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  javascript:(function() {
    const {title} = document;
    const url = `https://organice.200ok.ch?captureTemplateName=Media&captureContent=${title}&captureFile=/org/media.org&captureVariable_mediaURL=${
    window.location.href
  }`;
    window.open(url, "_blank");
  })()
#+END_SRC

** Bookmarklets Demo

*** iOS

This is what using a bookmarklet to capture a website looks like in iOS:

[[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/wiki/videos/demo-bookmarklet-iOS.gif]]

* Siri integration

The organice capture mechanism integrates very nicely with the [[https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios][Siri
Shortcuts]] feature in iOS, allowing you to use Siri to execute capture
templates.

You can use [[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/14f91f8cf8f547a183a0734396240984][this sample Shortcut]] to get started with this right away
in iOS 12 or newer. Open the link on your iOS device and click "Get
Shortcut". Then open up the Shortcuts app and edit the template by
following the directions in the comments. Then [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055][record a Siri trigger]]
and you're good to go!

* Comparison

** Beorg

Before starting work on organice, I did use Beorg and donated to it
multiple times, because I was very happy to have a good option to
access Org files on my phone with it.

The important differences to me are:

- organice is FOSS which is very much in the spirit of Org whilst Beorg
  is proprietary
- organice is web based, so there is no lock-in to a specific device or
  OS
- Beorg currently has better offline support


** org-web
organice has a shared history with [[https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web][org-web]]. In fact, it is a friendly
fork.

organice differs from org-web in that:

- It's a community driven project. See our
  - [[file:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md][Code of conduct]]
  - [[file:CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing guidelines]]

- It has the commitment of a Swiss company behind it to continually
  work on it.
  - This company is 200ok llc: https://200ok.ch/

- It has many bug fixes (for example on parsing and exporting org
  files) compared to its ancestry.
- It continues to evolve independently with it's own feature set.
  - For example: organice has WebDAV support.
- It is a project with equal focus on mobile as desktop browsers.
- org-web [[https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web/issues/75][tracks users]] with Google Analytics. organice [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/41][does not]].

*** What's new?

To see how organice differs from org-web, please consult the [[file:changelog.org][changelog]]
which contains the user visible changes since forking.

*** Acknowledgment

We are extraordinarily grateful to DanielDe the original creator!

We forked the project, because we have different visions on how to go
forward. He envisions a mobile only solution, we think it's great to
have organice be available to any browser to enable anyone on the go
or any non-Emacs user easy access to Org files. Also, DanielDe thinks
of org-web as [[https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web//issues/72][his pet project]] whereas organice has the full power of
[[https://200ok.ch][200ok llc]] behind it whilst building a strong self-sufficient community
around it.

Thank you for all, DanielDe!
