** Fixed

*** When exporting to email, don't just export the selected headline, but sub-headlines

** Added

*** Users can now share their headlines (including sub-headlines) to any app - with a fallback to mail.

- PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1036

* [2025-06-18 Wed]

** Fixed

*** Made it harder to accidentally swipe left or right on headers

- Changed swipe detection from fixed distance to relative distance (2x)
- This reduces accidental swipes while maintaining intentional swipe functionality
- PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1034
- Thank you [[https://github.com/vHugoObject][vHugoObject]] for the PRüôè

** Fixed

*** Repeater state changes will now always be filed to the correct header

- =updatePlanningItemsWithRepeaters= now selects the header it intends to update

PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1029

* [2025-05-24 Sat]

** Added
*** Duplicate header via long-press on '+' icon

- Long-pressing the '+' icon in the header action drawer now
  duplicates the current header and its entire subtree.
- Visual feedback for the long-press interaction has been
  significantly enhanced with larger surrounding shadows for better
  visibility, especially on touch devices.
- Short-press on the '+' icon continues to add a new, empty header.

PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1025

** Fixed
*** Table add/remove button inverted

PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1024

* [2025-05-22 Thu]

** Changed

*** Refactor and unify Docker setup for improved development and production builds

  - Introduce a multi-stage =Dockerfile=. This file defines distinct
    stages for =base=, =development=, =build=, and =production=,
    ensuring optimized layers and dependencies.
  - The production Docker image is lean, containing only necessary built assets and runtime dependencies.

This significantly simplifies Docker configuration management,
enhances the developer experience when using Docker, and builds upon
earlier work by @rogueai to create lean production images.

The PR is: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1023

* [2025-05-06 Tue]

** Added

*** Add visual cue for overdue headers when displaying headers

- Before this change: When enabling the setting "Show Deadline
  Display", the respective deadline will be displayed on each header
  line.
- After this change, in the deadline will show in grey if not overdue
  and in red if overdue.

This change was originally proposed and implemented by @dmorlitz:
https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/970

The merged PR is: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1019

** Fixed

*** Resolved issue where search input field could scroll off-screen on iOS devices
  - The search input in popups (like Search, Task List) will no longer
    attempt to automatically focus on iOS. This prevents the field
    from being pushed out of view by the virtual keyboard. iOS users
    will now need to tap the input to activate it.
  - On non-iOS platforms, the search input will now auto-focus with a
    slight delay to improve usability.
  - PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1018

*** CI Tasks: docker build/push and deploy-prod

- Building the docker image has been broken for some time.
- Deploying to prod via CI had an issue since switching to parcel.

Both seem to be working as of commit
e72d01081863e69f7410be87f09aeb2ac68e3c1d. There's no PR, because I
made these changes directly to the =master= branch, because these CI
tasks should only run for production ready code.

*** Switch from CRA to parcel

PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1014

This is a big one.

We've used Create React App as the main build tool which abstracted
stuff like Babel config away from us. In a recent release, we upgraded
from CRA v3 to v4 so we were able to upgrade some other dependencies.
However, CRA is EOL:
https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app

** Fixed

- Upgrades: When upgrading from CRA v3 to v4, the upgrade process
  broke. Clients that once started an old version of organice would
  forever cache that one.
  - Changing to Parcel (see above) also got rid of quite a bit of
    complexity:
    - Parcel has upstream capability to build scss which means we
      could delete a good bit of code.
    - Changelog Files are loaded not only at build time, but can be
      changed while running the dev server.

* [2025-04-05 Sat]

** Fixed

  - This improves the PWA experience for people self hosting organice

** Fixed

- Prevent accidental horizontal swipes during vertical scrolling on iOS
  - Improved touch handling to detect vertical scrolling intent and prevent unwanted horizontal swipe actions
  - PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/1012

* [2024-11-11 Mon]

- Major version technical upgrades
  - nodejs (from 12 to 20)
  - Create React App (from 3 to 4)
  - eslint (from 6 to 7)
  - node-sass to sass
- Minor version technical upgrades
  - redux-undo

  - Thank you [[https://github.com/dmorlitz][dmorlitz]] for the PRüôè

* [2023-01-04 Wed]

** Added

- Configuration option for a default Org file on startup.
  - By default, when you start organice, it will display your root
    file directory. If you prefer to display a specific Org file
    instead, you can select it in the [[https://organice.200ok.ch/settings][file settings]].

- Option to display DEADLINE values (near the clocking value) on each headline
  - The default for this option is false - so there is no change to the default behavior - until you enable this option via Settings.

** Changed

- Disable auto-capitalization for search
  - Before:
    - When using the search or task list text inputs the Android/iOS keyboards automatically apply the shift key, meaning that the first character is capitalized.
    - 99% of the time this is not what we want because:
      - Having mixed case triggers a case sensitive search. This is quite confusing when I did not intentionally use capitalization, but it was added anyway. For example, I type "and", and it actually inputs and searches for "And", which yields no results.
      - Many of the keywords in the search grammar are lower case, e.g., =deadline:=, =desc:=.
  - Now: Auto-capitalization is turned off

- Undo looks like it is persisting changes, but it persisted old
  state. Hence, reloading the file was bringing back the version of
  the file before undoing.

** Changed
- Simplify UX in task modal
  - "Change todo keyword set" is now an explicit button. Also, it's
    only shown when there is more than one todo keyword set configured
    for the current Org file.
  - Todo keywords can be selected and unselected on the same button.
    No trash can necessary to unselect a todo keyword..
  - PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/862

** Added
- Ability to handle empty files
  - This takes care of a big UX problem for users who solely rely on organice. So far, we've shown a parser error if the file is empty *or* if the file did not contain a headline.
  - Now, if the user opens a file that is empty, or has no headlines, she will see the call to action to create a new headline.

** Removed
- Google Drive support. This backend had a few issues:
  1. We waited [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/127][for years for Google to put the Google Drive API into
     production mode]]. Without that, only very few people were actually
     allowed by Google to use organice with Google Drive. A lot of
     time and effort went into this from quite a few of people. Even
     Google employees tried to expedite from within Google, but to no
     avail. The maintainers of organice gave up on this issue since
     [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/127#issuecomment-655339244][July 2020 and announced]] that the support for Google Drive will be
     removed unless someone steps up and takes over this task. Nobody
     did in the two years since, so we're removing it.
  2. [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/109][Replace integration of Google Drive through <script> include in index.html with NPM module]]
  3. [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/107][Sign in to Google Drive from new versions of Chrome dysfunctional]]

* [2021-12-09 Thu]
** Fixed
   - Title editor text loss.
     - Since the introduction of the semantic Title editor on [2021-11-22 Mon], if you modified the text of a title and then click a todo, the todo keyword got saved which triggers a rerender before the text got saved. Therefore the text is reset to the state it was in when the title editor was opened.
     - This is fixed, now.
* [2021-12-05 Sun]
** Added
   - *EPIC* Bookmark functionality for search
     - After entering a search string, you can bookmark it using the ‚≠ê button.
     - Bookmarked search strings populate the suggestions if no search string is entered into the input field.
     - Bookmarks are saved by context, so there are separate bookmarks for search, task-list, and refile.
     - There are at most ten bookmarks for a context. Newly saved bookmarks are inserted at the top of the list. If the list gets too long, the last search strings are dropped. Duplicate bookmarks are dropped too. The list of bookmarks is ordered by last used.
     - Bookmarks are unaware of file context. Therefore, you always have the same bookmarks.
     - Relevant PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/758
* [2021-11-22 Mon]
** Changed
   - Title and Description fields are not edited as raw text by default.
     - Instead, a semantic editor comes up when editing them.
     - To edit raw values, click the 'edit' icon, again.
   - Search and Task List open in one modal with tabs.
     - Modal opens to "Search" by default, but remembers what was opened last.
   - If there are open clocks, a third modal "Clock List" is added
     that looks like "Search" for =clock:now= without the search input
     field.
   - Notes can be multi-line and are properly indented.
* [2021-11-09 Tue]
** Added
   - Setting to respect OS light/dark-mode preferences
     - organice already queried the OS for light/dark-mode preference. But changing the setting in organice would override the OS preference.

** Fixed
   - Fix repeater adjusting time of date when using =.+=

** Added
   - *EPIC*: Multiple file support
     - Agenda, Search, Task List, Refile and Capture Templates have the ability to work on multiple files.
     - You can adjust the behavior for these on a file per file basis by creating "file settings" in the settings menu.

   - *EPIC*: Offline file support
     - Every file opened in organice will automatically be cached on your device.
     - When visiting the file, again, it will immediately be loaded from the local storage and then loaded from the remote back-end.
     - That makes loading and switching between files instant _and_ gives you the ability to work on multiple files when being offline.

** Fixed
   - Having an active timestamp with a repeater was broken.
     - When the TODO state changes for a header that has a repeater (either as SCHEDULED, DEADLINE or active timestamp), a log entry is written and the timestamp is updated.

* [2020-11-20 Fri]
** Fixed
   - organice understands =:PROPERTIES:= drawers and smartly parses the values in case one of the values is a timestamp.
     - However, parsing all the values and saving the parsed result in any case will lead to wrong results. Most values of properties are just plain text and non-interactive things in Org mode.
     - For example, a value like =something_with_underscores= would have been treated as 'underlined text' which doesn't make sense for a property drawer. When saving the value back, organice would have squashed the underlines.
     - Now, the values are used and preserved as they are. Timestamps still work, of course.

   - Safeguard against selecting text by accident.
      - Before this change, it was possible to select text when doing a 'swipe'.

* [2020-11-01 Sun]

** Changed
   - We have enabled some default settings by default, because they are reasonable for a new user:
     - =shouldStoreSettingsInSyncBackend=, because it enables using organice on multiple clients.
     - =shouldLiveSync=, because it reduces the chance to have a conflict in the open Org file.
     - =shouldSyncOnBecomingVisibile=, because it reduces the chance to have a conflict in the open Org file.
   - =bulletStyle= is set to "Fancy", because it looks more visually pleasing than an asterisk (*) and hence makes organice look better on a first test run.
   - If you personally do not want them enabled, you can disable them separately in the [[/settings][settings]] any time.

** Fixed
   - organice has various settings that the user can configure. Before manual configuration, there organice loads sane defaults. Loading and persisting some of these defaults was buggy before.
     - Loading and persisting of defaults works now.
     - Previously saved wrong values are removed from =localStorage= to reduce future bug potential.
     - Changing this is - strictly speaking - not visible to the end-user, so it wouldn't ordinarily show up in this changelog. However, since it makes changes to the already saved settings (in cleaning up old faulty values), it theoretically could introduce a bug in the settings. Hence, the change is added to the changelog.

   - The 'focus header' feature is renamed.

** Fixed
  - Search and Todo List modals could be moved off screen on iOS since [2020-08-30 Sun]. The fix is to disable =autoFocus= on iOS. The rationale for that documented here: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/462

* [2020-08-30 Sun]

** Added
   - Add note to header (=M-x org-add-note=)
     - This adds a button for taking notes to tasks (org-add-note). They will be prepended to the header contents after :PROPERTIES: and before the :LOGBOOK:
   - Auto-focus filter input fields (search and task-list)

* [2020-08-29 Sat]
** Fixed
   - If a user folds a header, all its subheaders should collapse as well, so that when the user reopens it, they stay closed.
     - The previous behavior is buggy in a way that it keeps the subheaders open as they were, restoring their openness when the header is unfolded.
     - The previous behavior is useful, though. So this change introduces a user setting to toggle the behaviour.

* [2020-07-28 Tue]
** Fixed
   1. Sync stuck when working in the background
     - When the user put organice into the background during a sync and comes back, organice was stuck in sync mode, but doesn't actually sync anymore. This means that any new changes to the Org file will not be persisted. This is due to mobile browsers cutting off most resources to browser apps in the background, so organice cannot guarantee that a sync happens properly in the background.
     - It's not trivial to find out if the job is stuck
       - Time is not a good indicator as bigger files on slower connections will always take longer.
       - There's no JS API to reliably find out if the browser just got back from the background or is put into the foreground. The [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API][=visibilitychange= API]] just triggers for both these events.
     - Hence, the implementation is generic in nature: Whenever the user hits the 'sync' button, an actual 'sync' is forced - even if organice thinks there's currently a sync in progress or that it should be debounced. That makes sense, because manual actions by the user should always be obeyed.
     - Closes issue https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/252
   - 2. On iOS >13.1, when organice is used in SPA mode (as a bookmark on the homescreen), and the user navigates away from the original bookmark, a huge URL Bar would show up with a "Done" button. This is a regression in how iOS handles full-screen SPAs. These are the relevant APIs:
     - https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/display
   - 3. Feature detection for =crypto.subtle= module
     - This is used for change detection in the changelog. The module is only available in secure contexts. Hence, when used locally and on a private IP range, depending on the browser, it might not be available.

** Fixed

     configured header path

* [2020-01-12 Sun]

** Added
   - Make HeaderBar sticky
     - Making undo/redo, file browser and help always available
       (before it was required to scroll all the way to the top)
   - Deselect headline by clicking into the title (or empty space) in
     the HeaderBar
   - Show Org filename in Header

** Fixed
   - *Major synchronization improvements*
     1. After undo/redo, synchronize Org file
     2. Debounce Sync
        1. When a user changes things quickly (which happens easily
           when having 'live sync' enabled and using undo/redo for
           example), multiple syncs ran in parallel. The back-ends
           will either get confused or fail with errors (429 too many
           write operations). In any case, likely the last written
           state would not have been the state of the Org file in
           organice.
     3. Safeguard against concurrent sync requests to the back-end
     4. In case of synchronization error, show the error to the user
        and retry synchronization
     5. Don't actually sync a whole Org file for an empty header.
        When the user adds some data and triggers
        UPDATE_HEADER_TITLE, then it makes sense to save it.

** Changed
   - Revert "Move HeaderActionDrawer before headline"
     - As per #188, the changes introduced in #100 didn't fare well

** Fixed

- On iOS 13, fix the regression which made capture input fields hide
  under the keyboard
  - More information and screenshots in the ticket: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/46
  - Turns out this issue is non trivial to fix and requires specific
    rules for every size of iPhone. I tested against the Xs and 6s. If
    you have a different form factor and the capture template input
    screen looks off to you, please send me a screenshot of what it
    looks like and I'll add the dimensions for your form factor right
    away!

** Added

- Implemented a =redo= Button next to the =undo= button

* [2019-09-21 Sat]

** Fixed

- Parser bug which would interpret *bold* statements in the beginning
  of a line as a header.
- Parser bug which would delete newlines between headers and items

** Changed

- @MTrost [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/45][introduced]] a new testing library called [[https://testing-library.com/docs/intro][React Testing
  Library]] which greatly simplified writing interaction tests.

* [2019-09-19 Thu]

** Changed

- Constraining to a max width and centering for tablets and bigger

* [2019-09-15 Sun]

** Fixed

- The 'Sync on application becoming visible' feature works on iOS and
  Safari
  - If enabled, the current org file is pulled from the sync backend
    when the browser tab becomes visible. This prevents you from
    having a stale file before starting to make changes to it.

* [2019-09-08 Sun]
** Added

- Documented how to use organice from a bookmarklet using the capture
  template feature

* [2019-09-06 Fri]
** Fixed

- Removed Google Analytics tracking, because it has no place here

* [2019-09-02 Mon]

** Added

- Configure Google Drive for the free community version of organice at
  https://organice.200ok.ch
- Documented SPA routing for self-hosting
- Wrote and publicized a Privacy Policy

* [2019-08-27 Tue]

** Changed

- Color scheme has been ported to the popular [[https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/][Solarized]] (light mode)
  - Whilst doing so, CSS variables have been introduced, so that
    there's not a whole lot of repetition of magic rgb values going on
  - The logo has been adapted, too
- The landing page and settings screens have been de-cluttered

* [2019-08-26 Mon]

** Added

- Continuous deployment: Merging to =master= triggers a build on CI
  and when successful, it triggers a deploy to https://org.200ok.ch
- Add a new temporary‚Ñ¢ logo: [[file:public/organice.png][organice.png]]

* [2019-08-25 Sun]

** Added

- Since we want organice to be a community driven project, we have added:
  - [[file:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.org][Code of conduct]]
  - [[file:CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing guidelines]]

- Add [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]] to run the tests on every commit
  - They are also integrated as a check for PRs with the benefit that
    contributors get automated feedback by running the regression test
    suite.

- Add [[https://greenkeeper.io][Greenkeeper]] for automated dependency management

- Add [[https://codeclimate.com][Codeclimate]] for automated maintainability analysis

** Changed

- Upgraded to Node 12.9

* [2019-08-12 Mon]

** Changed

- The default keybindings (when used from a desktop browser) are now
  more in line with the defaults in Emacs itself

** Fixed

- The keybindings work on non-macOS operating systems

* [2019-08-10 Sat]

** Added

- As a user, when in a directory listing, I want the folders and files
  to be sorted alphabetically. Furthermore, I only want to see files
  that organice can open (that is org and org archive files).
- Note: This is only implemented for the Dropbox back-end at this time.

** Changed

- Filters files from a directory listing down to org files.
- Sorts folders atop of files.
- Sorts both folders and files alphabetically.


* [2019-08-05 Mon]

** Added

- When the browser tab becomes visible, pull the latest version of the
  Org file
  - This is rather helpful when the app is used in production. Since
    the production build supports loading the complete application and
    org-file from cache, it can be open for a very long time. When the
    org-file hasn't been pulled in a "very long time"‚Ñ¢, then chances
    are non-nil that the file has been changed by another client in
    the meantime.
  - Without this change, when the user opens the app after a while,
    makes changes to the file and wants to sync to the back-end, there
    might be the message "Since you last pulled, a newer version of
    the file has been pushed to the server.". Now the user has two
    conflicting versions of the same file and can only chose to keep
    one (Which in itself is great UX and great error handling for
    cases in which we do encounter a merge conflict, of course!).
  - This situation is mitigated with this change. Now the user has the
    option to enable "Sync on application becoming visible" which acts
    similarly to "Live Sync". When the user opts to use this feature,
    whenever the application gets pulled from the background or
    started through the service worker, the first thing that happens
    it that a new version of the org-file is pulled from the server.
    It's therefore much harder for the user to create conflicts.

* [2019-08-04 Sun]

** Fixed

- Parser doesn't break indentation of existing files in fewer places
- Planning Items are formatted as in Emacs Org mode
- Properties are formatted as in Emacs Org mode
- Tags are formatted as in Emacs Org mode


* [2019-08-03 Sat]

** Added

- Documented deployment options
  - People have been asking for tighter access restrictions.
  - Imo the best answer to that request is to make it as easy as
    possible to host organice.
  - There's myriads of good options, of course. I picked to document
    two that will (potentially) be cost-free to the users and which
    are very easy and quick to set up: Ftp and Heroku.

** Fixed

- Tests on =master= were red
  - Partly due to obsolete tests
  - Partly because tests weren't updated according to changes in the code
