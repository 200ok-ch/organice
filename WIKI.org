**** Permissions ("Full Dropbox" vs. "App folder")

 The reference organice host [[https://organice.200ok.ch/]] has the
 permission type "[[https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide][Full Dropbox]]". This serves many users well -
 especially those who have Org files in various locations that they
 want to access.

 If you're a user and have concerns to give an application full access
 to your Dropbox, here are your options:

 1. You might not need to change anything after reading this: organice
    is a front-end application, there is no back-end and no monitoring
    whatsoever. So, when you login to Dropbox, only your browser will
    have access to your Dropbox. So, from a security perspective,
    you're not giving too much access to a server - your data cannot be
    seen by anyone else but you.

 2. organice is a free and open source application. Therefore, you can
    review the synchronization code anytime. For Dropbox, this is
    pretty straight forward since the synchronization code is less than
    200loc.

 3. If you still have concerns, you can take full control! Since
    organice is free and open source, you are free to host it yourself.
    You can also create your own integration with Dropbox and select
    the permissions as you wish. Here's [[#deployment][more documentation on deploying
    organice]].

*** WebDAV
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: faq_webdav
    :END:

**** Demo

  Here's a demo of how organice works when logging in to a WebDAV
  server.

  On the left, you see a branded version of OwnCloud, on the right you
  see organice. After logging in and making a minute change, you can see
  that the =last edited= timestamp in OwnCloud changes. Also, we're
  verifying the change directly in Emacs using Emacs and you can see the
  change has also been synchronized to my local machine.

  [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/wiki/videos/demo-webdav.gif]]

**** WebDAV test server
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: webdav_faq_test_server
     :END:

 For testing purposes, we use a Docker image with a proven and well
 documented server: Apache2 running on Debian. The WebDAV service is defined
 in the main =docker-compose.yml= file and can be used in both development
 and production profiles.

 You can build the Docker image yourself - and customize the Apache configuration
 to your needs by editing =doc/webdav/Dockerfile=.

 To build the WebDAV server image:
 #+begin_src shell
   docker compose --profile dev build apache-webdav # Or --profile prod
 #+end_src

 Then run the Apache2 WebDAV server:
 #+begin_src shell
   docker compose --profile dev up -d apache-webdav # Or --profile prod
 #+end_src

 On your host machine, you can now login with any WebDAV client using
 the URL =http://localhost:8080/webdav/=. There is no authentication
 configuration, so any user account works (including omitted user
 accounts). It goes without saying that if you wanted to use this for
 production, please enable authentication. Within the test image,
 you'll find the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/master/sample.org][sample.org]] file, so you can get started developing and
 testing right away. The WebDAV service is available in both =dev= and =prod= profiles.

 For testing WebDAV outside of organice, and you're an Emacs user, you
 can open [[/dav:localhost#8080:/webdav/][this]] link (=C-c C-o=). Then, you will get a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]] session
 with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] open and you'll see the sample file. You can interact with
 it like in any other dired buffer. Obviously, this link will not work
 when looking at the documentation in the browser, you'll have to open
 the file [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/master/WIKI.org][WIKI.org]] in Emacs.

 If you prefer a command line client, you could use [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/cadaver][cadaver]]. Install and use
 it like this:

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
 sudo apt -y install cadaver
 cadaver http://localhost:8080/webdav/
 #+END_SRC

***** Bug reports
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: webdav_bug_reports
      :END:

 If you have any trouble connecting to WebDAV using organice, it could
 be your setup (please consult [[#webdav_cors][CORS]] and [[#webdav_gotchas][Gotchas with WebDAV]]). In any
 case, if you want to open a bug report, please document your issue by
 referencing how it doesn't work using the official WebDAV test server.

**** CORS
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: webdav_cors
     :END:

 Since organice is a front-end application, it will login with
 JavaScript from within the browser - in turn the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS][Cross-Origin Resource
 Sharing (CORS)]] headers must be set appropriately. If they are not set,
 you will not be able to login to your service from a browser.
 Alternatively, if you're using a server like Apache or Nginx, you can
 simply get around CORS by hosting organice on the same domain as your
 service.

 Please note, that when your back-end does not set the correct CORS
 headers, organice cannot show you a really semantic error message on
 that. The reason is that browsers [[https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#handling-a-response-to-a-cross-origin-request][hide this information]] from
 JavaScript. You will simply get a network error. However, you can
 easily debug it yourself by looking into the JavaScript console. No
 worries, you don't have to be a (JavaScript) developer to find out
 about that - here's a screencast showing you how to do it:

 [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/wiki/videos/demo-webdav-failing-cors.gif]]

**** Gotchas with WebDAV
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: webdav_gotchas
     :END:

***** =preflight request doesn't pass access control check= error

  If you are getting an error like

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://my.site/dav/' from origin
  'https://organice.200ok.ch' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response
  to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not
  have HTTP ok status.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  then something is wrong with your webserver config.  You can check
  whether a CORS preflight check is returning the right headers via:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  curl -v -X OPTIONS https://my.server/webdav/

  # For the official organice Apache2 WebDAV test server:
  # curl -v -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8080/webdav/
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The output should include lines like this:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ...
  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  < Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  < Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS,DELETE,PUT,PROPFIND
  < Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin,Accept,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers,Authorization,X-CSRF-Token,Depth
  < Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
  < Allow: OPTIONS,GET,HEAD,POST,DELETE,TRACE,PROPFIND,PROPPATCH,COPY,MOVE,LOCK,UNLOCK
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  If your server doesn't give a =200 OK= response, or if the
  =Access-Control-Allow-*= headers are missing, you may find these
  articles helpful:

  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27703871/return-empty-response-from-apache/
  - https://serverfault.com/questions/231766/returning-200-ok-in-apache-on-http-options-requests/

***** Using Apache =RewriteEngine=
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: webdav_apache_rewrite_engine
      :END:

 If your WebDAV directory happens to be not only on the same webserver,
 but also within a subdirectory of the directory containing a
 =.htaccess= file containing a =RewriteRule= that also applies to the
 WebDAV directory (for example like [[#routing][this]]), then you will need to create
 another =.htaccess= file in the top-level WebDAV directory containing
 this:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 RewriteEngine Off
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 Otherwise any attempts to use WebDAV to upload new files via =HTTP
 PUT= requests will fall foul of the =/index.html= rewrite rule above,
 resulting in a =403 Forbidden= response.

 Another way to avoid this more selectively is to precede that rule
 with:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !PUT
 #+END_EXAMPLE

***** Symlinks don't work

  Unfortunately, [[https://serverfault.com/questions/453807/best-practice-to-link-with-webdav-as-followsymlinks-doesn-t-allow-to-show-symli][symlink support never made it into Apache's =mod_dav=]].

***** Bind-mounts of individual files don't work

  In an Apache =mod_dav= context, unfortunately you can't use [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/198590/what-is-a-bind-mount][bind
  mounts]] of a single file instead of symlinks, because =mod_dav=
  attempts to write any changes to a file atomically, by first writing
  to a temporary file and then [[https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/c3db73ca8a5aa7b79231a11fe2eb15de3ce943dc/modules/dav/fs/repos.c#L991][atomically renaming it to the target
  file]], and Linux prevents renaming to bind mounts with a =Device or
  resource busy= error.

***** =HTTP PUT= requests fail with =403 Forbidden=

  As mentioned in [[#routing][the section routing]], you should avoid having
  =mod_rewrite= rules apply to (=PUT=) requests in the WebDAV
  directories.

**** Configuring Nextcloud behind haproxy to allow WebDAV
  If you're running Nextcloud behind [[https://www.haproxy.com/][haproxy]] it's entirely possible to use it with
  organice using WebDAV. ...it's just a little bit convoluted.

  The first part is the haproxy config. It should look a little bit like this:

  #+NAME: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf
  #+BEGIN_SRC conf
    frontend www
      acl host_nextcloud hdr(host) nextcloud.example.org
      acl path_nextcloud_public_webdav path_beg /public.php/webdav
      # Because we need to inspect the path in the backend section we set a variable
      # containing the path.
      http-request set-var(txn.path) path
      # Because the OPTIONS requests from organice doesn't include authentication we
      # need to fake it. We can do that by redirecting all requests that satisfy these conditions:
      #
      # + host is Nextcloud
      # + path is for public webdav
      # + HTTP method is OPTIONS
      use_backend always200ok if host_nextcloud path_nextcloud_public_webdav METH_OPTIONS

    # haproxy doesn't really have a way of returning an arbitrary response, unless
    # you want to drop down to Lua. There's no need for that, though, as this works
    # perfectly fine. This backend doesn't have any servers attached, so it'll
    # always result in a 503. We override the 503 by setting a custom errorfile,
    # which incidentally looks just like an HTTP 200 response and contains all the
    # headers we need to satisfy a CORS request.
    backend always200ok
      mode http
      errorfile 503 /etc/haproxy/errors/200-ok.http

    # The Nextcloud server backend is configured here. We inject CORS headers if URL
    # starts with `/public.php/webdav`.
    backend nextcloud
      mode http
      option httplog
      acl is_webdav var(txn.path) -m beg /public.php/webdav
      http-response add-header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" if is_webdav
      http-response add-header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET,POST,OPTIONS,DELETE,PUT,PROPFIND" if is_webdav
      http-response add-header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Origin,Accept,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers,Authorization,X-CSRF-Token,Depth" if is_webdav
      http-response add-header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true" if is_webdav
      server backend01 127.0.0.1:8001
  #+END_SRC

  The ~errorfile~ needs to look something like the below. Note that the text below
  has carriage returns (~13~, ~o15~ or ~0x0d~); these are required as per the HTTP
  RFC!

  #+NAME: /etc/haproxy/errors/200-ok.http
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text/html
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS,DELETE,PUT,PROPFIND
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin,Accept,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Access-Control-Request-Method,Access-Control-Request-Headers,Authorization,X-CSRF-Token,Depth
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    <html><body><h1>200 Stuff is good!</h1>
    Something something dark side.
    </body></html>
  #+END_SRC

**** Nextcloud sharing
  In order to share a document using WebDAV you might be inclined to try to follow
  the [[https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/16/user_manual/files/access_webdav.html#accessing-public-shares-over-webdav][official documentation]], but it can be a tad confusing. Here's the executive
  summary for how to share things from Nextcloud using WebDAV:

  + share a link to a folder/file
  + remove everything but the token from the link; the token matches
    ~/[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/~ (hit the button right of "Share link" if using the web
    interface)
  + use these details when logging in:
    + URL :: https://nextcloud.example.org/public.php/webdav
    + Username :: the token, e.g. ~ed65Fxw9Bz3MTn3~
    + Password :: if you've set a password for the shared folder, here's where you
                  input it

**** WebDAV Config
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: webdav-config
:END:

If you want to self-host organice and want to configure a default
WebDAV server for your instance, you can by setting the variable
=REACT_APP_WEBDAV_URL= in the =.env= file.

** Can we add feature X from plugin Y?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: can-we-add-feature-x-from-plugin-y
   :END:

   organice is an implementation of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] (see [[#what-does-this-project-do][What does this
   project do?]]). Therefore, it is important that the changes in the
   markup made by organice are 100% compatible with Org mode itself.

   Hence, if feature X from plugin Y can be implemented in a
   compatible way, and the feature follows the [[#contributing][contribution guideline]],
   then: Yes, the feature can be added to organice.

** Org Habits
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org_habits
   :END:

organice supports Emacs Org mode's habit tracking feature with a visual consistency graph. Habits are TODO items that you want to track consistently over time, like daily exercise or meditation.

#+html: <p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/268c68a9-e338-44fe-a6b2-60571c7b4753"/> </p>

*** Creating a habit

To create a habit, add a =STYLE= property with the value =habit= to your TODO item:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* TODO Exercise
    SCHEDULED: <2026-01-07 Wed .+1d>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :STYLE:    habit
    :END:
#+END_SRC

The habit uses standard Org mode repeater syntax on the scheduled date to define when the task should repeat (e.g., =.+1d= for daily, =.+1w= for weekly). See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html][upstream Org documentation]] for details on the different repeater types (=.=, =++=, =+=).

Habits also support a special minimum/maximum range syntax using a slash: =.+2d/4d=. This means "do this task at most every 2 days, but at least every 4 days." The first value is when it will first appear in the agenda, and the second value is when it becomes overdue.

*** Understanding the consistency graph

In the agenda view, habits display a visual consistency graph below the title. This graph shows your habit completion history with color-coded days:

- *Green*: You completed the habit on this day
- *Blue*: Not due yet (in the grace period before the next scheduled date)
- *Yellow*: Scheduled for this day, or due tomorrow
- *Red*: Overdue (you missed this day)

The graph displays the configured number of preceding days (default: 21) and following days (default: 7). Each day shows the first letter of the weekday (M T W T F S S).

*** Habits vs regular tasks

Habits are sorted before regular tasks in the agenda view, making them easy to find. The consistency graph only appears for items with the =STYLE: habit= property.

The habit calculation uses your =:LOGBOOK:= entries to determine which days you completed the habit. When you mark a habit as DONE, a =LAST_REPEAT= property is automatically set to track when you last completed it.

*** Habit settings

In Settings > Base, you can configure:

- =Org habit preceding days=: How many days of history to show in the graph (default: 21)
- =Org habit following days=: How many future days to show (default: 7)
- =Show all habits today=: When enabled, all habits appear in today's agenda view, even if not scheduled or already marked DONE

These settings sync across devices when using a sync backend.

** Can I access local files?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: access_local_files
:END:

Q: Can I open and edit .org files directly from my device's storage in
organice?

Currently, organice cannot directly access .org files stored on your
device's local filesystem. This isn't a limitation of organice itself,
but rather a fundamental security restriction of web browsers and
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

Web browsers intentionally restrict direct access to a device's
filesystem to protect users' security and privacy. This means that web
applications like organice can only access files through supported
cloud storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive, or WebDAV).

While some newer APIs like the File System Access API exist, they have
limited support (mainly on desktop Chrome) and don't solve the use
case for most mobile users.

This is why organice is designed to work with cloud storage services,
ensuring your .org files remain accessible and editable across all
your devices while respecting browser security boundaries.

*Android Users:* There is a way to access local files by setting up a
local WebDAV server using Termux. This allows you to run organice with
access to files on your Android device. You can find the detailed
setup instructions here: [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/tree/master/contrib/organice-on-android-with-webdav-server][organice-on-android-with-webdav-server]]

**** Architecture Decision Record: Use ADRs

***** Context

   organice aims to be a helpful and accessible tool for many users
   and developers over years to come. Hence, practicing discipline of
   architecture is very important.

   - We want to think deeply about all our architectural decisions,
     exploring all alternatives and making a careful, considered,
     well-researched choice.
   - Even when the above statement does not hold true and we walk a
     pragmatic path, we want to be as transparent as possible in our
     decision-making process.
   - We want to be able to revisit prior decisions to determine fairly if
     they still make sense, and if the motivating circumstances or
     conditions have changed.

***** Decision

   We will document every architecture-level decision for organice
   with an [[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions][Architecture Decision Record]]. These are a well structured,
   relatively lightweight way to capture architectural proposals. They
   can serve as an artifact for discussion, and remain as an enduring
   record of the context and motivation of past decisions.

   The workflow will be:

   1. A developer creates an ADR document outlining an approach for a
      particular question or problem. The ADR has an initial status of
      "proposed."
   2. The developers and maintainers discuss the ADR. During this
      period, the ADR should be updated to reflect additional context,
      concerns raised, and proposed changes.
   3. Once a maintainer has made a decision, the ADR can be
      transitioned to either an "accepted" or "rejected" state.
   4. Since the team working on organice is very agile and good architecture
      often emerges from actual code and spikes, it is very well possible
      for code to already be committed to the repository before the ADR
      is accepted or even addressed as an ADR.
   5. If a decision is revisited and a different conclusion is reached, a
      new ADR should be created documenting the context and rationale for
      the change. The new ADR should reference the old one, and once the
      new one is accepted, the old one should (in its "status" section)
      be updated to point to the new one. The old ADR should not be
      removed or otherwise modified except for the annotation pointing to
      the new ADR.

   We will use the popular ADR template by [[https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/4fba870a4e8e6830d0b9aa150c145103aa34b634/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md][Michal Nygard]] using [[#adr-001][this
   template]].

***** Status

  Accepted

  (Note: This ADR was written when Create React App (CRA) and its =react-scripts= were the project's build system. The project has since migrated to Parcel (see ADR-004). The considerations around "ejecting" were specific to CRA. While the core decision of this ADR may still apply, the alternatives and their downsides would be evaluated differently with the current Parcel-based build system.)

***** Consequences

   1. Developers must write an ADR and submit it for review to make
      any architectural decision transparent -- that is, any decision
      that affects the way organice is put together at a high level.
   2. We will have a concrete artifact around which to focus discussion,
      before finalizing decisions.
   3. If we follow the process, decisions will be made deliberately,
      by the maintainers.
   4. We will have a useful persistent record of why the system is the way it is.


*** adr-002-static-content-pages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adr-002
:END:
**** Architecture Decision Record: Static Content Pages

***** Context

organice runs different kinds of pages:

1. Static content like the Landing Page
2. The actual application

These two do not share a whole lot in common. They have different
needs in terms of CSS, Javascript, but also code quality. However,
they run from the same =<App>= component which already has the
assumption that it'll contain the actual application, not a content
page like the Landing Page.

This might seem convoluted and maybe there is a better solution. The
seemingly only other solution is to =yarn eject= from =react-scripts=,
so that we could have multiple starting HTML files for multiple SPAs.
This has the following downsides, though:

 1. =react-scripts= is a great wrapper which we cannot use anymore.
 2. Related to 1: Ejecting will create dozens of files which will have
    to be maintained manually.

***** Decision

The downsides of ejecting seem larger than sharing the same =<App>=
component and creating safeguards in the code where necessary to
differentiate between the two use cases.

***** Status

   Accepted

***** Consequences

- Some safeguards in the code like:
  - Setting a =landing-page= class dynamically in =<Entry>= if the
    application is showing the Landing Page.
  - Making sure that static content pages do not =import= CSS code
    that pollutes the global namespace (reminder: CSS is not component
    local by default in React). Instead, we employ SCSS and scope all
    selectors under a unique identifier.


*** adr-003-synchronization-back-ends
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adr-003
:END:
**** Synchronization back-ends

***** Context

Different users like to synchronize their files using different
back-ends. Some prefer open standards and to host the required services
themselves - others prefer to pay for a closed source service so that
they don't have to worry about storage of their data themselves. The
spread of strategies employed by these back-ends couldn't be further
apart - some work in hunks and commits, some on files, etc.

To accommodate every personal synchronization strategy, organice
should be easily extensible.

***** Decision

organice employs the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern][Strategy Pattern]] which is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern][design pattern]] made
to do the 'same thing' (like storing and retrieving files) with
'different strategies' (like employing different APIs for Dropbox,
GitLab, and WebDAV). 

***** Status

   Accepted

***** Consequences

Implementing a client for a new synchronization back-end is quite
easy:

1. Take any of the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/tree/master/src/sync_backend_clients][existing back-ends]] as a template. If you already
   happen to know how the API of your new synchronization back-end
   works, you can pick the closest one. Ultimately, it doesn't make a
   big difference from where you start off.
2. Implement the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/blob/d00e1e31b3c675b3be71c0e0150f8ad7292766b0/src/sync_backend_clients/webdav_sync_backend_client.js#L133-L143][8 functions defined by the strategy pattern]]:
   1. =isSignedIn=
   2. =getDirectoryListing=
   3. =getMoreDirectoryListing=
   4. =updateFile=
   5. =createFile=
   6. =getFileContentsAndMetadata=
   7. =getFileContents=
   8. =deleteFile=
3. That's it😂


*** adr-004-using-parcel
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adr-004-using-parcel
:END:

**** Context

We've used Create React App as the main build tool which abstracted
stuff like Babel config away from us. In a recent release, we upgraded
from CRA v3 to v4 so we were able to upgrade some other dependencies.
However, CRA is EOL:

There are many options given in the EOL announcement on how to
continue.


**** Decision

We're going with one of the ways that seems both easiest and at the
same time less tightly coupled than others. We're going with parcel
which has the claim "The zero configuration build tool for the web.
📦🚀"

Here's the upstream migration guide that I followed:
https://parceljs.org/migration/cra/


**** Status

   Accepted

**** Consequences

***** Testing

We use Jest for testing. Parcel doesn't include support for that
directly, but there's a migration path: https://parceljs.org/migration/cra/#6.-migrate-tests

Since we don't have CRA anymore, we have to 'eject' and have lots of
manual configuration files now:

- babel.config.json, because jest uses babel and parcel does not
- config directory for jest
- jest.config.json for jest
- various manually installed packages

All of these changes to get the ejected version running can be seen in
commit b171dcca.

***** Sass

We have already migrated from node-sass to sass in the past.

With parcel, we have sass functionality integrated, once again. In
case we ever need it, again, here's the commit removing all manual
sass logic: 26fc36d0


* Internals
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: internals
  :END:

 This section will document various aspects of the internals of
 organice, to help developers more quickly understand how it works.

** Management of settings

  organice stores settings in up to three different locations:

  - the Redux store, e.g. ~this.store.getState().base.get('shouldLiveSync')~
  - the browser's local storage, e.g. ~localStorage.getItem('shouldLiveSync')~
  - an =.organice-config.json= file in the sync backend (only if the
    =shouldStoreSettingsInSyncBackend= setting is enabled)

  The flow logic is as follows:

  - When the app is loaded:
    - An initial in-memory state is formed by ~readInitialState()~
    - If the user is signed in, ~loadSettingsFromConfigFile()~ is
      called to retrieve =.organice-config.json= from the sync
      backend.
